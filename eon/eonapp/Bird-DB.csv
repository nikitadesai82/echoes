In the late 1980s, the Shinkansen 500 Series faced a major engineering problem — when the train exited tunnels at high speed, it created a “tunnel boom”, a loud shockwave caused by compressed air.

Eiji Nakatsu, the chief engineer on the project and a keen birdwatcher, noticed that the Common Kingfisher dives from air into water with barely a splash, thanks to its streamlined beak shape.

By redesigning the train’s nose to mimic the long, tapered beak of the kingfisher, engineers:

Eliminated the sonic boom,

Reduced air resistance by ~30%, and

Improved energy efficiency by around 15%.

This example is a classic case of biomimicry — applying principles from nature to solve human engineering problems."	"The common kingfisher exhibits both resident and migratory behaviors, depending on the geographical location of the population. "	"Its habitat consists of freshwater environments like streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds with clear, slow-moving water and overhanging branches for perching. Tropical populations are also found  in mangrove creeks and swamps."	"Breeeding Season: From April to September. This is the only time this otherwise solitary bird can be seen in pairs. 

Courtship: Males will chase females, whistling loudly to attract them. Males may offer food to females to help establish pair bonds. 

Nest: Nests are excavated into vertical earth, sand, or clay banks near water, such as riverbanks, cliffs, or artificial banks.

Clutch Size: 2 to 10 glossy white eggs are incubated for ~ 20 days.
"	"The common kingfisher primarily feeds on small fish.  Its natural diet also includes aquatic insects, crustaceans like prawns, and small amphibians such as tadpoles. It hunts from a perch 1–2 m (3–7 ft) above the water. From here it plunges steeply down to seize its prey usually no deeper than 25 cm (10 in) below the surface. The wings are opened underwater and the open eyes are protected by the transparent third eyelid. Kingfishers fly low and straight like bullets, reaching up to 25 miles per hour. Their beaks are sharp, pointed, and so long that they make up a third of a kingfisher's height, these beaks slice soundlessly through water meaning kingfishers can dive into pools without alerting fish."	"Which of the following adaptations helps the Common Kingfisher hunt effectively underwater?

A. Its eyes can focus in both air and water, and its long, pointed beak reduces water resistance when diving.
B. It closes its eyes underwater and relies only on its sense of touch to catch prey.
C. Its short, curved beak helps it scoop up fish from the surface while hovering.
D. Its large nostrils allow it to breathe underwater while chasing prey.

? A. Its eyes can focus in both air and water, and its long, pointed beak reduces water resistance when diving.

Explanation:
The Common Kingfisher has special visual adaptations—it can adjust the curvature of its lens to focus clearly both above and below water. Its streamlined, dagger-like beak enables swift, precise dives with minimal splash, helping it spear or grasp fish efficiently."

"The cattle egret  is a cosmopolitan species of heron and they are found in the trophic, subtrophic and warm temprate zone. The cattle egret is the most terrestrial heron, being well-adapted to many diverse terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Habitats, including grasslands, agricultural fields, and wetlands.  Cattle egrets give a quiet, throaty rick-rack call at the breeding colony, but are otherwise largely silent."	"Bredding Season: The breeding season varies geographically but typically aligns with the start of the wet season and lasts from roughly March to August in some regions, while in others like Australia, it is from October to March.

Courtship: The male displays in a tree in the colony, using a range of ritualised behaviour, such as shaking a twig and sky-pointing. A new mate is chosen in each season.

"	"In Indian rural folklore, the Cattle Egret is often seen as a symbol of which of the following?

A. Laziness, because it lets cattle do the work of finding food
B. Harmony with nature, as it follows cattle peacefully and helps by eating insects around them
C. Bad luck, as its presence is believed to foretell storms
D. Messenger of rain, appearing only during the monsoon season

? B. Harmony with nature, as it follows cattle peacefully and helps by eating insects around them.

Explanation:
In many parts of rural India, the Cattle Egret is affectionately known as gai bagula or goru bagla and is seen as a friend of cattle and farmers. Its habit of staying close to grazing herds is interpreted as a peaceful coexistence between species, reflecting the Indian cultural view of nature’s interdependence and balance."

Also the bird has been described as ""bagla bhagat"" or ""wolf in sheep's clothing""."	"The Indian Pond Heron is a sedentary species, meaning it does not undertake long-distance migration. The species moves locally in response to environmental conditions, such as flooding and drought."	"The Pond Heron inhabits a wide range of wetlands like ponds, marshes, and riverbanks, as well as agricultural areas such as rice fields.

Courtship: The Indian Pond-Heron engages in distinctive courtship displays to attract a mate. Males often exhibit elaborate flight patterns and vocalizations, showcasing their agility and strength. These displays help in establishing a bond with potential mates and asserting dominance in the vicinity.

Nest: Indian Pond-Herons prefer nesting in areas close to water bodies such as ponds, lakes, or marshes. They often choose trees or shrubbery for nesting, and build simple nests using sticks and twigs.

Clutch Size: Three to five eggs are laid which hatch at different times between 18 to 24 days later."	"primarily feeds on a diet consisting of fish, crustaceans, insects, and small amphibians. Its hunting technique involves standing motionless in water, suddenly darting to catch prey. In the wild, it adjusts its diet seasonally, feeding on aquatic insects like dragonflies and damselflies during warmer months, and shifting to more fish and crustaceans during monsoon seasons"	"In Indian village folklore, the Pond Heron, often seen standing still by the water’s edge, is sometimes used as a symbol of what trait?

A. Wisdom, for its patience in waiting for prey
B. Deception, for appearing calm and still but striking suddenly
C. Purity, for its white breeding plumage during monsoon
D. Good fortune, as it appears near fertile fields

? B. Deception, for appearing calm and still but striking suddenly

Explanation:
In many parts of India, the Pond Heron (“bagula” in Hindi) is used in idioms describing a hypocrite — someone who appears serene or saintly but hides cunning intentions. The phrase “bagula bhagat” literally means a “heron devotee,” mocking false piety."	"During the breeding season, it showcases beautiful white plumage on its body with long filamentous feathers on the crown and neck. Its non-breeding plumage is more subdued, with brown streaks on its head, neck, and back, allowing it to blend into its surroundings.

Clutch Size: 1 or 2 eggs which are incubated for around 45 days."	"The diet of booted eagles consists of a wide range of animals including birds, small mammals, reptiles, rodents, amphibians, and insects. The booted eagle typically hunts on the wing, stooping quickly with wings folded in and feet extended. The booted eagle typically flies at relatively low heights, making it conspicuous. The call is a shrill kli-kli-kli."	"Question:
The Booted Eagle occurs in two distinct colour forms — pale and dark. What is the advantage of this variation?

A. It helps males and females identify each other during breeding.
B. It allows the species to blend into different habitats, improving camouflage while hunting.
C. The dark form absorbs more heat at high altitudes, while the pale form reflects sunlight in open areas.
D. It indicates age — pale birds are juveniles, and dark ones are adults.

? B. It allows the species to blend into different habitats, improving camouflage while hunting.

Explanation:
The Booted Eagle shows color polymorphism — individuals may be pale (with light underparts and contrasting flight feathers) or dark (uniform brown). This variation helps them adapt visually to different environments, from open grasslands to wooded or rocky regions, offering better camouflage and hunting success."	There are two quite distinct plumage forms with the Booted eagle. This buzzard-sized eagle has a long tail to accompany its slender build. It sports white patches at the base of its wings and they occur in pale and dark morphings.
