They are brilliant mimics and can copy human speech as well as everyday sounds like whistles and ringtones. ","The Alexandrine Parakeet is non-migratory, though it exhibits local seasonal movements in search of food and water, especially outside the breeding season. Flocks may travel considerable distances between feeding and roosting sites.","Capable of living at an altitude of upto 1,200 m the Alexandrine Parakeet pefers to live in forests, woodlands, agricultural lands and orchards as well as in close proximity to urban and rural human settlements. ","Breeding Season: Varies by region. November to April in India and March to June in Southeast Asia.

Nest: Alexandrine Parakeets are monogamous and form strong pair bonds. They nest inside tree cavities, often taking over old woodpecker holes. In urban areas, they may also use suitable man-made structures. Nest sites are chosen for safety and height.

Clutch Size: 2 to 4 white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for about 24 to 28 days while the male brings food to her. After hatching, the chicks stay in the nest for about 6 to 7 weeks before fledging. They continue to depend on the parents for a while after leaving the nest.","Alexandrine Parakeets primarily feed on fruits, berries, seeds, nuts, grains and flower buds. They forage in tree canopies and on the ground, often holding food with one foot while eating. their zygodactyl feet (two toes facing forward and two facing backwards) allow them to do this. Their strong, curved beak and agile tongue allow them to strip fruit, husk seeds and peel bark to reach food inside. They frequently visit fruiting and flowering trees or chards and farmlands, especially during early mornings and late afternoons. While admired for their striking presence, they are also known to raid crops such as maize, rice and sunflower, which can sometimes create conflict with farmers.","The overall plumage of the Alexandrine Parakeets is bright green, with a bluish-green back of the neck and yellowish-green underparts.

These movements are often influenced by fruiting patterns of trees and availability of host species for breeding.","Asian Koels may be seen in tropical and subtropical forests, open woodlands, mangroves, plantations, gardens and other urban green spaces. This bird prefers areas with fruit-bearing trees, especially figs and banyans and is often found near human settlements. Its adaptability allows it to inhabit both rural and urban environments up to altitudes of about 2,000 m.","Breeding Season: Varies by region. In India, it usually occurs from March to August. In Southeast Asia, it is mainly from October to February. The timing always aligns with the nesting season of the host birds.

Courtship Display: The male calls loudly and repeatedly to attract the female. Courtship feeding is common with the male offers fruit to the female.

Nest: Asian Koels are brood parasites. They do not build their own nests. Instead, the female quietly lays 1 or 2 eggs in the nests of other birds, usually House Crows and Jungle Crows and sometimes Mynas or Drongos. She may remove one of the host's eggs to avoid being detected. The unsuspecting host birds incubate the eggs and raise the chicks.

Clutch Size: 1 to 2 eggs. Koel chicks often hatch earlier than the host's young and may push out the host eggs or chicks to get more food. The host parents then feed and care for the young koel as if it were their own.","The Asian Koel feeds mainly on a wide variety of fruits and berries, particularly figs, banyans, papayas and other soft, fleshy fruits. It is an active and opportunistic feeder, usually foraging alone or in pairs among the canopies of fruiting trees. Using its strong beak, it plucks fruits quietly while moving through dense foliage, often going unnoticed.

These birds prefer shady forest interiors and can live in higher altitudes of up to 2,000 m.","Breeding Season: April to August, though timing can differ slightly by region.

Nest: A small, neat cup-shaped nest is made from fine roots, grass and spider webs. It is usually placed on a horizontal branch or in the fork of a tree, about 2 to 6 meters above the ground. Both the male and female help build the nest and take turns warming the eggs.

Clutch Size: 2 to 4 pale pinkish-white eggs with reddish spots. The male is especially alert and aggressive around the nest, defending the territory from intruders. Both parents feed and care for the chicks until they fledge.","The Asian Paradise Flycatcher feeds mainly on flying insects such as flies, moths, beetles and other small invertebrates. It is a highly agile and active hunter, often flitting through the forest canopy or open woodland. Using a technique called sallying, it darts out from a perch to catch insects in mid-air and then returns to the same or a nearby branch. It may also hover briefly near leaves or bark to pick insects off the surface, especially when feeding young. This species usually forages alone or in pairs, although during migration it may join mixed-species flocks for better feeding opportunities.

Nest: Barn Owls are monogamous and often stay with the same mate for many years. They do not build a typical nest. Instead, they lay their eggs directly in natural cavities, barns, deserted buildings or nest boxes. These places offer shelter and protection from predators.

Clutch Size: 4 to 7 white eggs. The female incubates the eggs for about 30 to 34 days while the male hunts and brings food. Chicks hatch at different times because the eggs are laid over several days. Both parents feed and care for the young. The chicks usually fledge or leave the nest at around 7 to 8 weeks and become independent shortly after.","The Barn Owl is a nocturnal predator, hunting mainly at night and sometimes at dusk or dawn. It feeds primarily on small mammals such as mice, voles and shrews, but may also catch small birds, bats and insects. The owl flies silently and low over open fields, grasslands and farmlands, locating prey with its exceptional hearing and sharp night vision.

Migrating to tropical climates, the Eurasian Golden Oriole can be found in savannas, plantations and gardens during the winter months.","Breeding Season: Mainly from May to July in temperate regions.

Nest: The nest is a deep, cup-shaped structure that hangs like a hammock between forked twigs high up in trees. It is made from fine grass, bark fibers and spider silk, which helps keep it strong and neatly bound. Both the male and female work together to build the nest in a well-hidden location among leaves.

Clutch Size: 3 to 5 pale eggs with dark spots. The female incubates the eggs for around two weeks. After hatching, both parents feed the chicks until they are ready to fledge, usually after 14 to 17 days. The male often sings near the nest.","The Eurasian Golden Oriole feeds on a mix of insects and fruit. It consumes insects, such as caterpillars, beetles and grasshoppers and hunts among tree canopies, picking prey from leaves or catching them mid-air. It also eats fruits and berries, including mulberries, figs and cherries. During the breeding season, it relies heavily on protein-rich insects to feed its chicks. In its forest and woodland habitats, the Oriole often forages high in the canopy, moving carefully among foliage to find food.

Migrating in the autumn (September to October), they return occurs in spring (March to April). The Eurasian Hoopoe population that reside in tropical regions however, does not migrate. ","The Eurasian Hoopoe prefers open habitats such as grasslands or chards, savannas, farmland, scrublands and dry wooded areas. These habitats offer warm, temperate and tropical climate with soft soil suitable for probing insects. This bird avoids dense forests and deserts but is often seen near human settlements, especially in rural areas. ","Breeding Season: April to July, with timing depending on the region.

Nest: Hoopoes are cavity nesters, meaning they nest inside natural holes such as tree trunks, cracks in walls or cliff openings. They may also use nest boxes. The cavity is lined with a small amount of grass or leaves for comfort. A special feature of their nests is a strong odor produced by a secretion from a gland near the tail (uropygial gland). This smell is believed to help protect the nest from predators and parasites.

Clutch Size: 5 to 8 eggs. The female incubates the eggs for about 15 to 18 days while the male brings her food. After the chicks hatch, both parents feed them until they are ready to leave the nest, usually after 25 to 30 days.","The Eurasian Hoopoe feeds mainly on insects, larvae and other small invertebrates. It is a ground forager, usually seen walking with a bobbing motion in open areas such as grasslands, fields and gardens. Using its long, slender, downward-curved bill, it probes the soil, leaf litter and even animal droppings to find hidden prey like beetles, crickets, worms and grasshoppers. It may flick prey into the air before swallowing. Feeding activity is highest during the morning and late afternoon, when insects are most active. The hoopoe also follows grazing animals to seize insects disturbed by their movement. It hunts primarily by sight and prefers open habitats where prey is easier to detect.","Eurasian Hoopoes are easy to recognize because of their colourful appearance and unique crest.

Courtship Display: White Throated Kingfishers usually live alone. During the breeding season, they form pairs. The male gives loud, sharp mating calls to attract a female. 

Nest: They dig a tunnel-like nest in mud banks along rivers or lakes. They may also nest in forest areas or even in urban gardens if suitable soil banks or holes are available. The tunnel leads to a small chamber where the eggs are laid.

Clutch Size: 4 to 7 eggs.","The White Throated Kingfisher feeds on a wide range of prey including insects such as grasshoppers, beetles and termites, as well as crustaceans, earthworms, frogs, lizards, rodents and even small birds. Though known as a kingfisher, it is not limited to water habitats. It hunts effectively on land and only catches fish when near suitable water bodies. The bird usually hunts from a perch, watching carefully for movement below before making a swift dive or direct swoop to seize prey with its strong bill. After catching its prey, it typically beats it against a hard surface to kill or immobilize it before swallowing. Feeding activity is often highest in the early morning and late afternoon.","White Throated Kingfishers have a bright blue back, wings and tail, while the head, shoulders, sides and lower belly are rich chestnut-brown. The throat and breast are clean white, making a strong contrast against the darker feathers. The bill is large and bright red and the legs are also red.

It belongs to a different evolutionary lineage within the family Sylviidae. Its bright yellow eyes make it stand out among grassland birds! When alarmed, the bird often raises its tail and emits sharp, scolding notes to warn others.","Yellow Eyed Babbler will only make local seasonal movements in response to rainfall and food availability, especially in arid (dry) regions. These movements are typically short-range and irregular.","The Yellow Eyed Babbler can be found in grasslands, scrub jungles, reed beds, agricultural fields, open woodlands and wetlands, particularly areas with dense shrubs or tall grasses. While common in lowland regions, these birds can be found up to an altitude of 1,500 m. They have readily adapted to rural and semi-urban environments that are located near water sources.","Breeding Season: May to September, usually during the monsoon.

Courtship Display: Pairs call to each other, chase playfully and perform short display flights. The male may offer bits of nesting material to the female, a behavior that helps strengthen their pair bond.

Nest: A deep cup-shaped nest made from grass, leaves and plant fibers is lined with soft materials like roots or cotton. The nest is placed low in tall grass, reeds or shrubs and is well hidden from predators.

Clutch Size: 3 to 5 glossy white eggs with reddish or brown speckles. Both parents share incubation and feed the chicks once they hatch. They are very vocal and defend their nesting area together.","The Yellow Eyed Babbler feeds mainly on insects and other small invertebrates, including caterpillars, beetles and grasshoppers. It also eats small fruits, berries and seeds, especially outside the breeding season. It is an active and nimble forager, usually seen in pairs or small groups moving quickly through grasses, shrubs and reeds. The bird searches for prey by gleaning insects from leaves and stems, sometimes making short aerial sallies to catch insects in mid-air. Feeding activity peaks in the early morning and late afternoon. Its agile movements, hopping, climbing and clinging to grass blades, help it capture prey hidden within dense vegetation.","Yellow Eyed Babblers are rufous-brown, with whitish underparts and pale buff feathers on the sides. The head and back of the neck are a rich rufous shade that blends into a white throat and breast. The bright yellow to orange-yellow eye, surrounded by a white ring and a fine dark line through the lores, gives the bird a sharp and alert expression. The wings are rufous-brown and the long, stepped tail is brown above with whitish tips.

When these familiar little birds disappear from cities, it often means there are fewer insects, more pollution or fewer safe nesting spots, warning us that the environment around us is in trouble.","A largely non-migrant bird, the House Sparrow moves locally in search of food or to warmer and lower altitudes in the winter.","Well adapted to living around humans, the House Sparrow can nest in factories, warehouses and homes. Tolerant of a variety of climates, this bird prefers drier conditions and has evolved to have a high salt tolerance and an ability to survive without water by ingesting berries. Notably, the only terrestrial habitats that the house sparrow does not inhabit are dense forest and tundra. ","Breeding Season: In warm regions, House Sparrows can raise several broods a year, nesting between April and August. 

Nest: Nests are built in small holes or cavities in walls, under roof-eaves, in unused spaces in buildings or sometimes in tree holes. They also readily use nest-boxes if available and favour places close to people. 

Clutch Size: Usually 4 to 5 eggs per clutch. Eggs are white, bluish-white or greenish-white with brown or grey spots. Incubation lasts about 11 to 14 days. Both parents feed the young. ","The House Sparrow eats mostly seeds and grains, but is highly adaptable and opportunistic. In rural areas, it feeds on spilled grain and seeds from fields; in cities, it often scavenges for scraps, bread or leftovers near human dwellings. In summer, adults also eat insects like beetles, caterpillars, flies and ants. These are also feed these to young chicks, since insects are rich in protein which is necessary for growth. House Sparrows often forage on the ground or near buildings, hopping and scratching for seeds or crumbs and may gather in flocks or around bird-feeders.","Often seen around human settlements, the House Sparrow is a small bird. Males have grey crowns, chestnut-brown upperparts with black streaks and a bold black patch on the throat and upper chest called a bib. The cheeks are pale and the underparts are greyish. Females lack the black bib and chestnut crown; they are brown above with darker streaks and have a pale buff eyebrow that gives a softer look. The bill is stout and perfectly shaped for cracking seeds. Young birds or juveniles look like females but are even paler and more uniformly brown until they mature.",Omnivore,Diurnal,Non-Migratory,Common.
