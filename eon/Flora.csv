The tree's branches spread out like roots, giving it the famous ""upside-down"" appearance.","Some Baobab trees are estimated to be over 2,000 years old, making them among the oldest living trees on Earth. Infact, their hollow trunks were sometimes used as homes, storage rooms, prisons or even chapels in African villages.","The Baobab is often called the ""Tree of Life"" because it can store up to 120,000 liters of water in its trunk during the rainy season, which helps it survive severe droughts. It plays a vital ecological role, providing food and shelter for birds, bats, insects and mammals, while also enriching the soil with organic matter from its fallen leaves. It is also regarded as an indicator species for ecosystem health and an important ally in climate adaptation efforts.","Every part of Baobab, bark, leaves, pulp, seeds and roots is used in traditional African and Ayurvedic medicine. The fruit pulp is rich in vitamin C, calcium and antioxidants, used to treat fevers, diarrhea and scurvy. Leaf extracts are used for anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antimicrobial purposes. The bark and roots are used to make tonics and poultices for treating malaria, toothache and gastrointestinal issues. The seed oil has emollient properties and is applied to the skin for moisturizing and wound healing.","The Baobab is a traditional food plant in Africa. The fruit pulp is eaten raw or mixed into drinks, porridges and sauces, known for its tangy, citrus-like flavor. The seeds can be roasted as snacks or ground to produce baobab seed oil, used in cooking and cosmetics. Young leaves are cooked as vegetables or dried into powder for soups and sauces. In many African cultures, the fruit pulp is used to make traditional energy drinks and fermented beverages.","The Baobab holds deep cultural and spiritual importance in African traditions. It is often considered sacred, symbolizing life, wisdom and strength. In many African communities, it serves as a meeting place, with gatherings, rituals and storytelling sessions held under its shade. In regions of India, where it was introduced centuries ago, it is often found near temples and heritage sites, symbolizing longevity and resilience.","Bark: Thick and fibrous, forming massive hollow trunks that are sometimes used by people as shelters, storage spaces or places of gathering.
